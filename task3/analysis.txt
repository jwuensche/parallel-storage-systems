This implementation can be greatly optimized by reducing the amount of write
calls necessary to the file descriptor.  Each call adds some overhead especially
since the changes which have been get updated in parallel and each iteration
calls fsync. Additionally the fsync calls are not necessary to be called on
after every write call.  A simpler version would be to call fsync once at the
end of each operation to ensure that the iteration is written to the disk.

Further improvement can be done in multiple ways, for example a serialization of
results of the whole matrix or calling another thread which handles the file
synchronization allowing the calculation on the main memory version of the
matrix to continue.
