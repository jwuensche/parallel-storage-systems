# `write` vs `pwrite`

Both functions are mostly identical in their working receiving a file
descriptor, a buffer containing the content and a the size of the content to be
written in bytes.  The return type represents the total bytes which have been
actually written.

Differences can be seen in two points. For one, `pwrite` receives one more
parameter describing the position where the buffer should be written (instead
of at the current position of the file offset as in `write`). Due to this, the
file offset does not get changed when using `pwrite`.  In POSIX pwrite operates
indepedently from the `O_APPEND` flag, whereas in Linux this leads to data
being appended regardless of the given offset.
