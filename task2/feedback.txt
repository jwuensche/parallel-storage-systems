Comments:

Some of the structures (nested allocations) were a bit limiting for the
implementation, in the checkpoint task it felt more about working around the
structure especially in the case of atomic checkpointing (our implementation
involves explicit copying there). I don't know if this was intentional to
encourage problem solving for potential other situations, where solutions like
in matrix operation are not possible. Maybe we also missed something in this
task which made it more difficult for us in this case :D
