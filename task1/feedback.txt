For an introductory sheet it's nice to point to man page resources as many don't really
mention them for beginners at all. Very nitpicky, but I would have pointer students to the
short shell introduction on swcarpentry, at the end of task 1 or the beginning of 2 as the
usage of manpages can be confusing if one never worked with a shell before.  But that's
just personal impression on previous experiences in tutorials, it may be completely fine
for all students in this course.
