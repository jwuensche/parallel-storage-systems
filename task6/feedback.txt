Comments:

Overall I found the tasks to be quite nice for some handywork on a smaller C
project, it's also beneficial in learning how to design good structures in the
C language. This might go more in the software engineering direction, it could
be a good idea to note just a few principles for good C software design to
students early on in the exercise, aka after the first FUSE task or similar.

Feedback to the handed in solution:

A few things are missing from our implementation, mainly the reinitialization
of the FS once it has been terminated. The deserialization functionality is
implemented in the deserializers.h header, but due to some bugs in our
implementation we did not manage to finish in time, as we first focused on
fixing those.

The serialization on the other should be working as intended.

Many small errors happened in our bitmap, which had to be fixed later on as we
tested the base serialization functionality. This also lead to some
modifications for performance reasons, further delaying the final goal.
Maybe a less error prone data format or picking an already implemeted data
structure which would serve our needs would have been better in this case.

The performance benchmarks can be performed and completed, but numbers may not
be representing the final results as more page writes etc might need to occur
to ensure a valid reinitialization.
